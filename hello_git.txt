Testing everthing I have learnt on how to clone and push code from the terminal using git commands

The steps include;

Creating a new public repo on Github and copying the SSH
using "git clone + SSH" to clone the repo locally
using "touch + filename.ext" to create file from terminal
using "code ." to open VScode inside the current directory
using "git status" to see what files have actions to be taken
using "git add + filename.ext" or "git add ." to add all changed files to be committed
using "git commit" (because of the change we have made, commit messages will be typed in vscode) or "git commit -m "commit message here"" to add commit messages 
using "git push origin main" or "git push" to push the changes made locally to the Github repo

Finally you can use "git log" to see the timeline of all actions carried out
